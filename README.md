Draft for checklist for programming review

The purpose of this document is to provide a framework to review your work and the work of others. It is a liveable document that may change depending on timeframes, needs, changes in technology, or changes in overall goals.

Code Reviewing for others:



* Don’t be rude just to be rude, we’re all here for one goal
* Explain reasoning of why it needs to be improved
* If you have a better approach feel free to suggest that instead
* Include a positive point for every negative: this helps motivation and may also help people where they need to learn more or where their strengths are


### **1. Verify feature requirements **



1. Is there a feature ticket? 
2. Does it cover the requirements described by the feature ticket?


### **2. Code readability and naming**



1. Is the code self-explanatory?
2. Is the code readable?
3. If not readable:
    1. should it be broken up? 
    2. Reorganized? 
4. Are the function names and variables clear (can you understand what that element or variable does?)?


### **3. Coding Style **



1. Does this match the coding style guide?


### **5. Code duplication **



1. Does this function exist?
2. Does the library already exist?


### **6. Tests **



1. Usability for end-users: is it easy to navigate for someone brand new to the Meta? 
2. Scale: can it handle a sudden input of users at once?
3. Repeatable: Is the intended feature repeatable by others?


### **7. Documentation **



1. Is there a readme file that explains how/why to use a feature?
2. Does a new feature need to update an old one or does it need its own new document?
